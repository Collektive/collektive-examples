/** Draws a bullseye pattern based on network distances and node positions.
 * This function identifies two distant nodes (extremes) in the network to define a main axis,
 * then computes an approximate center point (intersection of two diagonals),
 * and finally assigns a value based on the distance from this central node, creating
 * concentric zones.
 * The returned value is intended for visualization (e.g., as a color gradient from 0 to 100),
 * allowing the rendering of a bullseye pattern across the network.*/
